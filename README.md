# Actuarial Dissertation 



My actuarial dissertation focussed on the numerical aspects around the computations of **XVAs**. I started from looking at the classic numerical methods, mainly Monte-Carlo and then to look at supervised learning algorithms like *Gaussian Process Regressions* and *Neural Networks*. This repository contains most of the research I did  during the period June 2024 - October 2024 for the writing of my actuarial dissertation which is available at this [link](https://samymekk.github.io/files/M%C3%A9moire_d_Actuariat-Samy.pdf).

## Repository stucture 


- A folder named **Thesis_and_Slides** which contains both my actuarial dissertation in a **PDF** format and the slides I presented as a **beamer** during my oral defense on the **6 November 2024**.

- A folder named **Code** which is composed of subfolder nameds according to the corresponding chapters in my actuarial dissertation
  
   * A folder named **Chapter 3 : Some Use Cases for CVA computation** which will contain through notebooks **almost all** the relevant codes used in the chapter 3.
   * A folder named **Chapter 4 : Taking account the Wrong Way Risk** which will contain through notebooks **all the codes** which generate the results I present in the chapter 4.
   * A folder named **Chapter 5 : Presentation of ML and DL methods for XVA computations** which will contain through notebooks **some part of the codes** I used to generate the results in the chapter 5.
   * A folder named **Chapter 6 : Applications of ML and DL methods for XVA computations**  which contains through notebooks **some part of the codes** I used to generate the results in the chapter 6.
   * A folder named **Chapter 7 : Toward methods to hedge CCR** which contains **some parts of the code** I used for the writing of the chapter 7.
  * A folder named **Annexes-Deep Galerkin** which contains **all the code I used** for the writing of the **annex Deep Galerkin**.


- A text file **requirements.txt** which contains all the necessary packages I used for the code development.


## Notes 

- I will work on improving the code structure.
